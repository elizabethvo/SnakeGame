A simple snake game by Elizabeth Vo-Phamhi.

File descriptions:

* PennDraw.java: Standard drawing library. This class provides a basic capability for
 creating drawings with your programs. It uses a simple graphics model that
 allows you to create drawings consisting of points, lines, and curves
 in a window on your computer and to save the drawings to a file. (Penn CIS)

* Food.java is a simple class file to make random food instances with 
appropriate getters.

* SnakeGame.java is a class file to make snake game instances which have
the core functionality of the game; the drawing of the board, the drawing
of the snake, keyboard controls etc. 

* Play.java is the main class file to run to play the game. It implements
an infinite while loop so that the user can have the option to play the game 
over and over again, with a new instance of SnakeGame created every time.

* The .wav files "mii music.wav", "wahh.wav", and "munch.wav" are back-
ground music and sound effects. 

* Donut.png, sushi.png, milk.png, popsicle.png, and taco.png are image files
used in the Food class to draw different kinds of food.

It took a long time to figure out how to use an infinite while loop
so that the game could be re-playable. Also figuring out the limitations
of the snake; you need to constantly update and keep track of not only the 
current direction of the snake, but also the directions that the snake is
not going in.
